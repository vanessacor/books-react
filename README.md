# Express Api and React App

## Description

This project is a simple API and Single Page Application (SPA) designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It's a practical exercise to improve my skills in the following areas:

- **Building an API with Node.js:** Developing a backend service using Node.js and Express.js to handle requests and manage data.
- **Creating a SPA with React:** Implementing a front-end application using React
- **Domain-Driven Development (DDD) Principles:** Applying some principles of Domain-Driven Development to structure the project.
- **Refreshing React Skills:** Review React concepts and best practices
- **Exploring New Developments in React:** Learn the latest features and updates in React, such as hooks, context API, etc..
